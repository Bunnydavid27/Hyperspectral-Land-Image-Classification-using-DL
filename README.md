Hyperspectral Image Classification is a remote sensing and computer vision challenge. It entails categorizing pixels in hyperspectral pictures into several classes depending on their spectral signature. Hyperspectral photographs contain information on an object's reflectance in hundreds of tiny, contiguous wavelength bands, making them ideal for variousÂ applications such as mineral mapping, vegetation study, and urban land-use mapping. This model will identify and categorize the image into different lands.
